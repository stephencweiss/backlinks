# Backlinks

This project is intended to work with a directory of nonplain text files to keep a list of backlinks up to date within the frontmatter of file.

It is inspired by Andy Matuschak's notes, his [note-link-janitor](https://github.com/andymatuschak/note-link-janitor), and heavily leverages the work of [Jared Gorski](https://github.com/jaredgorski) and the [nonplain org](https://github.com/nonplain/).

This project was bootstrapped with TSDX. The [user guide](./docs/tsdx-user-guide) has been moved to the `/docs` directory.
